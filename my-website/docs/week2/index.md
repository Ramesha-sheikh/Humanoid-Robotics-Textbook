# Week 2: Robot Anatomy, Kinematics, and Control Basics

Welcome to Week 2! Building upon our introduction to Physical AI, this week we dive into the fundamental components that make physical interaction possible for robots. We'll dissect the robot's body, understand how its movements are described, and explore the core principles that enable precise control in the physical world.

In this week's lessons, you will:

- Understand the physical structure of humanoid robots, including actuators and end-effectors.
- Get an introduction to robot kinematics, the science of motion without considering forces.
- Learn about the basics of robot control systems that enable desired movements.
