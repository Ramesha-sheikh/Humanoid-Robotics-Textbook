# Week 3: ROS 2 Architecture & Core Concepts

Welcome to Week 3! This week marks a significant step into the practical world of robotics as we introduce the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software, providing tools, libraries, and conventions that simplify the complex task of building robotic applications. We'll explore its core architecture and fundamental concepts that enable modular and distributed robot control.

In this week's lessons, you will:

- Understand the high-level architecture of ROS 2 and its key components.
- Learn about ROS 2 nodes, the fundamental processing units in a ROS graph.
- Explore ROS 2 topics, the primary mechanism for real-time data exchange.
