# Week 4: ROS 2 Communication: Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions

Welcome to Week 4! This week we deepen our understanding of ROS 2 by exploring its various communication mechanisms in detail. Beyond just topics, we'll delve into services for request-response interactions and actions for long-running, goal-oriented tasks. Mastering these communication patterns is crucial for building robust and interactive robotic applications, especially for humanoid robots that require sophisticated coordination.

In this week's lessons, you will:

- Revisit ROS 2 topics and advanced QoS settings.
- Understand ROS 2 services for synchronous communication.
- Explore ROS 2 actions for asynchronous task execution.
- Learn how to integrate these communication types in complex robot behaviors.
- Practice implementing publishers, subscribers, clients, and servers.
- See how these concepts apply to humanoid robot control.
