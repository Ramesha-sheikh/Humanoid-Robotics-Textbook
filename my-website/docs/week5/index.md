# Week 5: Advanced ROS 2 Topics: Services and Actions in Depth

Welcome to Week 5! This week, we will deepen our understanding of ROS 2 communication by thoroughly exploring Services and Actions. These powerful interaction paradigms are essential for building sophisticated robotic behaviors that require synchronous request-response patterns or goal-oriented, long-running tasks. We will not only revisit the theoretical underpinnings but also dive into practical implementation details.

In this week's lessons, you will:

- Master the nuances of ROS 2 Services for synchronous, one-to-one communication.
- Gain expertise in ROS 2 Actions for managing complex, asynchronous robot tasks.
- Understand the differences, use cases, and best practices for each communication type.
- Implement practical examples of both Service Clients/Servers and Action Clients/Servers.
- Learn how to integrate these advanced communication primitives into comprehensive robot applications.
