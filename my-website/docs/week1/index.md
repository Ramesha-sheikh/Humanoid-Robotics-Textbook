# Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to Week 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook! This week, we lay the groundwork for understanding how artificial intelligence can transition from the digital realm into embodied systems that interact with the physical world. We'll explore the fundamental concepts that bridge the gap between abstract AI algorithms and the tangible actions of a humanoid robot.

In this week's lessons, you will:

- Explore the foundational principles of Physical AI.
- Understand the shift from purely digital intelligence to embodied intelligence.
- Learn about essential sensor systems that enable robots to perceive their environment.
