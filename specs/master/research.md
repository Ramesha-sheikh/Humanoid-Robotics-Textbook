# Research Findings for Physical AI Textbook

This document consolidates research findings and clarifications made during the planning phase.

## Technical Context Clarifications:

- **Testing**: Resolved by defining Jest/React Testing Library for frontend and Pytest for backend, based on the project's technical stack.
- **Performance Goals**: Resolved by setting goals for fast UI loading and responsiveness, smooth animations (60fps), low-latency RAG chatbot responses (<500ms for common queries), and efficient document ingestion into Qdrant, inferred from the project's success criteria and technical stack.

## Constitution Check:

The `constitution.md` file was identified as a template requiring user input. The user has confirmed that this file has been updated with the project's core principles and gates, resolving this clarification point.

## Further Research Notes:

No further research tasks were explicitly dispatched as immediate technical clarifications were resolved through defined assumptions and user input.
