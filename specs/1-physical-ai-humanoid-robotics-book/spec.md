# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## 1. Overview

This specification outlines the requirements for developing a "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" as a Docusaurus-based online textbook. The book's central theme is "Embodied Intelligence + AI Systems operating in the real physical world." It will cover foundational concepts in robotics, simulation, AI platforms, and advanced topics like Vision-Language-Action systems, culminating in a Capstone project on autonomous humanoid robots. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive, hackathon-ready resource with professional formatting.

## 2. User Scenarios

As a student or researcher in physical AI and robotics, I want to:
- Access well-structured and professionally formatted content on ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Platform, and Vision-Language-Action systems so that I can learn about embodied intelligence.
- Follow a 13-week curriculum covering various modules so that I can systematically acquire knowledge and skills in physical AI and humanoid robotics.
- Find hackathon-ready materials and resources so that I can quickly prototype and experiment with real-world AI systems.
- Understand the integration of AI systems with physical robots through practical examples and simulations.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Course Content Modules
- The book shall contain Module 1: ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System).
- The book shall contain Module 2: Gazebo & Unity (Digital Twin Simulation).
- The book shall contain Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform (AI Robot Brain).
- The book shall contain Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Systems.
- The book shall contain a Capstone module: Autonomous Humanoid Robot.

### 3.2 Weekly Breakdown
- The book shall provide content structured according to a 13-week breakdown, covering:
    - Weeks 1–2: Intro to Physical AI
    - Weeks 3–5: ROS 2 Fundamentals
    - Weeks 6–7: Gazebo Simulation
    - Weeks 8–10: NVIDIA Isaac Development
    - Weeks 11–12: Humanoid Development
    - Week 13: Conversational Robotics

### 3.3 Deliverables
- The book shall be delivered as a Docusaurus-based website.
- The Docusaurus website shall include all chapters of the book.
- The content shall adhere to professional formatting standards.
- The book and its associated resources shall be "hackathon ready," implying practical, reproducible examples and minimal setup.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Readability & Accessibility
- The book shall be easily readable and navigable by students and researchers.
- The Docusaurus site should be accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

### 4.2 Maintainability
- The Docusaurus site structure should be maintainable and easy to update.

### 4.3 Performance
- The Docusaurus site should load quickly and provide a smooth user experience.

## 5. Assumptions

- The target audience has basic programming knowledge.
- The book will primarily be consumed online via the Docusaurus platform.
- "Hackathon ready" implies clear instructions, readily available code, and minimal setup complexity for practical exercises.

## 6. Constraints

- The book must be built using Docusaurus.
- The content must cover the specified modules and weekly breakdown.
- The project deadline is aligned with a hackathon, emphasizing practicality and ease of use.

## 7. Success Criteria

- All required modules are completely covered within the Docusaurus book.
- The weekly breakdown for content delivery is accurately reflected in the book's structure.
- The Docusaurus book is professionally formatted, consistent in style, and free of grammatical errors.
- Users can easily set up and run code examples, confirming the "hackathon ready" status.
- The book effectively conveys the course theme of "Embodied Intelligence + AI Systems operating in the real physical world."
