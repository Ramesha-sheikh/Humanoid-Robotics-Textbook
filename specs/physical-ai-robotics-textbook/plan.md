# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook (Hackathon I)\n\n**Branch**: `master` | **Date**: 2025-12-07 | **Spec**: specs/physical-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md\n**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/physical-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md`\n\n**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.\n\n## Summary\n\nDeliver the world’s first fully AI-native, open-source, Quarter 4-level textbook that turns Agentic AI engineers into Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics engineers in 15 weeks — fully deployed on GitHub Pages within 10-day hackathon window. This will be achieved through 4 parallel tracks: Content Generation, Frontend (Book), Backend Agent, and Demo Videos, following a 15-chapter lesson plan with a strict 1+1+1 CoLearning rule per *lesson*.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: Python 3.11  \n**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, FastAPI, OpenAI/Groq, ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim  \n**Storage**: GitHub Pages (frontend content), Local filesystem (generated content, project files)  \n**Testing**: Unit and integration tests for ROS 2 nodes and FastAPI agent. Validation of code snippets in simulation environments. Overall book deployment validation on GitHub Pages.  \n**Target Platform**: GitHub Pages (Frontend), Linux server/container (Backend Agent), Linux/WSL (Student development environment)  \n**Project Type**: Web application (Docusaurus frontend, FastAPI backend)  \n**Performance Goals**: Backend FastAPI agent live and functional at `/chat` endpoint.  \n**Constraints**: 10-day hackathon deadline, 15 chapters, 1800-2500 words/lesson, ~45,000 words total, 1+1+1 CoLearning pattern per lesson, 100% formatting consistency, \"Ask your AI\" exercise title, code snippets runnable in simulation, 3 demo videos, strict Constitution v1.0.0 adherence.  \n**Scale/Scope**: 15 chapters, ~45,000 words (assuming 3 lessons/chapter * 15 chapters * ~1000 words/lesson average).\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- [x] **Embodied Intelligence First**: Plan ensures lessons bridge digital AI to the physical world.\n- [x] **One Element Per Type Rule**: Plan explicitly states strict adherence to 1 Theory + 1 Exercise + 1 Application per *lesson*.\n- [x] **Professional Learner Experience**: Plan targets GIAIC Quarter 4 level.\n- [x] **95%+ Consistency Target**: Plan aims for 100% formatting consistency.\n- [x] **Spec-Driven Development**: The entire workflow for content generation is based on the spec.\n- [x] **Formatting Rules**: Plan adheres to \`.claude/output-styles/lesson.md\` for formatting and \"Ask your AI\" for exercise titles.\n- [x] **Technology Stack (Locked)**: Plan utilizes Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, FastAPI, Python Agents, ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, OpenAI/Groq, and Vision-Language-Action models as per the constitution.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/physical-ai-robotics-textbook/\n├── plan.md              # This file (/sp.plan command output)\n├── spec.md              # Feature specification\n├── research.md          # (Potential for future research documentation)\n├── data-model.md        # (Potential for future data model definitions)\n├── quickstart.md        # (Potential for future quickstart guide)\n├── contracts/           # (Potential for future API contracts)\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/sp.tasks command)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nbackend/\n├── src/\n│   ├── api/             # FastAPI endpoints (e.g., /chat for VLA)\n│   ├── services/        # Logic for interacting with ROS 2, Isaac Sim, LLMs\n│   └── models/          # Data models for backend\n└── tests/\n\nfrontend/\n├── src/\n│   ├── docs/            # Docusaurus content (chapters)\n│   └── components/      # Docusaurus components\n└── tests/\n\nros2_ws/                 # ROS 2 workspace\n├── src/\n│   └── humanoid_robot_pkg/ # ROS 2 package for robot control, simulation interfaces\n├── build/\n└── install/\n\nisaac_sim_assets/        # Assets and scripts for NVIDIA Isaac Sim\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a web application structure with a Docusaurus frontend for the textbook, a FastAPI backend for the AI agent, and dedicated directories for ROS 2 workspace and Isaac Sim assets.\n\n## Complexity Tracking\n\n> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**\n\n| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\n| N/A | N/A | N/A |\n
