## Prompt

```text
I've successfully created the `06-rclpy-integration.md` file and updated the `sidebars.ts` to include it. This completes all the sub-tasks for Module 1: ROS 2.

Now, I need to:
1. Mark the "Writing chapter on rclpy Integration" todo as `completed`.
2. Mark "Develop Module 1 – ROS 2: Robotic Nervous System" as `completed`.
3. Start the main task for Module 2: "Developing Module 2 – Gazebo & Unity: Digital Twin Simulation" as `in_progress`.
4. Create a PHR for this completed module and the initiation of Module 2.
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed all sub-tasks for Module 1 (ROS 2) and initiated Module 2 (Gazebo & Unity: Digital Twin Simulation). The todo list has been updated to reflect this progress, and a PHR has been generated.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All Module 1 content created and integrated. Module 2 development started.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: New markdown files for Module 1 sub-topics created; sidebars.ts updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin writing content for Module 2 sub-topics, starting with Physics in Simulation.
- 🧠 Reflection: The modular approach to content creation is effective for managing large projects.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Module completion and transition
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Focus on ensuring consistency in simulation code examples.
