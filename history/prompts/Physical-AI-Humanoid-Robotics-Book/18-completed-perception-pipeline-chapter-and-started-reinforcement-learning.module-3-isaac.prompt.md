## Prompt

```text
/sp.implemnet my-website all modules
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed the "Module 3: Perception Pipeline" chapter, updated the sidebar, and transitioned to "Reinforcement Learning" in the todo list. A PHR has been generated to document these steps.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Perception Pipeline chapter created and integrated. Progression to the next module task.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: `my-website/docs/module-3-isaac/02-perception-pipeline.md` created; `my-website/sidebars.ts` updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin writing content for "Reinforcement Learning".
- 🧠 Reflection: Understanding Isaac ROS packages and their role in accelerating perception tasks is crucial for developing efficient robotic systems.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Content creation and task progression
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Focus on practical examples and configurations for Reinforcement Learning.
