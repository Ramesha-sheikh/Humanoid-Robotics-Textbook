## Prompt

```text
I have successfully created the content for the "Module 2: Physics Simulation" chapter and updated `my-website/sidebars.ts` to include it. I've also updated the todo list to mark "Physics Simulation" as completed and "Sensor Simulation" as in-progress.

Now I need to create a PHR for this action.
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed the "Module 2: Physics Simulation" chapter, updated the sidebar, and transitioned to "Sensor Simulation" in the todo list. A PHR has been generated to document these steps.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Physics Simulation chapter created and integrated. Progression to the next simulation module task.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: `my-website/docs/module-2-digital-twin/02-physics-simulation.md` created; `my-website/sidebars.ts` updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin writing content for "Sensor Simulation".
- 🧠 Reflection: Detailed explanation of physics concepts is vital for understanding robot behavior in simulation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Content creation and task progression
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Focus on providing practical examples and configurations for sensor simulation.
