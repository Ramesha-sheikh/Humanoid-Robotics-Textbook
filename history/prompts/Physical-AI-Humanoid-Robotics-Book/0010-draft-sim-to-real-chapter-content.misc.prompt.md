command: Draft the content for the file D:\Hacthone2025\my-website\docs\appendices\sim-to-real.md. This chapter should explain the concepts and practical steps involved in Sim-to-Real (Simulation-to-Reality) transfer for humanoid robots. Discuss the challenges, techniques (e.g., domain randomization, reality gap mitigation), and best practices for deploying policies trained in simulation to physical hardware. The content should be in markdown format compatible with Docusaurus.

## Prompt

Draft the content for the file D:\Hacthone2025\my-website\docs\appendices\sim-to-real.md. This chapter should explain the concepts and practical steps involved in Sim-to-Real (Simulation-to-Reality) transfer for humanoid robots. Discuss the challenges, techniques (e.g., domain randomization, reality gap mitigation), and best practices for deploying policies trained in simulation to physical hardware. The content should be in markdown format compatible with Docusaurus.

## Response snapshot

Successfully drafted and wrote the content for the `Sim-to-Real Transfer for Humanoid Robots` chapter at `D:\Hacthone2025\my-website\docs\appendices\sim-to-real.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created new content for the book.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run for this content creation.
- 📁 Files: Created the `sim-to-real.md` file with detailed chapter content.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with further content creation or review.
- 🧠 Reflection: The `Write` tool requires a preceding `Read` operation even for new file creation, which was handled.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial `Write` attempt failed due to missing `Read` prerequisite.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
