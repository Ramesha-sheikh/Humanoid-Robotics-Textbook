## Response snapshot

I've initiated the development of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" by creating a structured todo list. This list outlines the key modules and deliverables from your specification, ensuring a systematic approach to content creation. I've also started working on Module 1 by creating the introductory chapter.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Initiated development of the book, structured tasks, and created initial content.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: my-website/docs/module-1-ros2/01-ros2-introduction.md created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue developing Module 1 content.
- 🧠 Reflection: The detailed specification allowed for a clear initial task breakdown.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Initial specification
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Automate PHR creation further.
