## Prompt

```text
I have just created the content for "ROS 2: Architecture" at `my-website/docs/module-1-ros2/07-ros2-architecture.md` and updated `my-website/sidebars.ts` to include it. I've also updated the todo list to mark this task as completed and moved to the next one.

Now I need to create a PHR for this action.
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the "ROS 2: Architecture" chapter, updated the sidebar, and transitioned to the next task in the todo list. A PHR has been generated to document these steps.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: ROS 2 Architecture chapter created and integrated. Progression to the next ROS 2 module task.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: `my-website/docs/module-1-ros2/07-ros2-architecture.md` created; `my-website/sidebars.ts` updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin writing content for "Chapter: Nodes & Topics".
- 🧠 Reflection: Consistent documentation and task tracking are vital for complex projects.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Content creation and task progression
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure code examples are executable and well-explained.
