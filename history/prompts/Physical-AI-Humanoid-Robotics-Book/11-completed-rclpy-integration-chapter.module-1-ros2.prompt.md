## Prompt

```text
I have just updated `D:\Hacthone2025\specs\master\tasks.md` to mark "Writing Chapter: rclpy Integration" as completed, and also updated the `TodoWrite` list accordingly. This completes all tasks for Module 1 in the `tasks.md` file.

Now I need to create a PHR for this action.
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully marked "rclpy Integration" as completed in `tasks.md` and `TodoWrite`, completing all Module 1 tasks in the plan. A PHR has been generated to document these steps.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All Module 1 content tasks from `tasks.md` are completed and recorded.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: `D:\Hacthone2025\specs\master\tasks.md` updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with updating `sidebars.ts` to include all planned modules for deployment.
- 🧠 Reflection: Keeping task documentation synchronized with actual progress is critical for project visibility.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Task completion and documentation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Focus on systematically adding all remaining module categories to the sidebar.
