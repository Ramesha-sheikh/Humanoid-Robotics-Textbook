## Prompt

```text
/sp.implement
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed the "Module 4: LLM → ROS Action Planner" chapter, updated the sidebar, and transitioned to the "Capstone: End-to-end robot pipeline chapter" in the todo list. A PHR has been generated to document these steps.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: LLM → ROS Action Planner chapter created and integrated. Progression to the Capstone module task.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: `my-website/docs/module-4-vla/02-llm-ros-action-planner.md` created; `my-website/sidebars.ts` updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin writing content for "End-to-end robot pipeline chapter" (Capstone).
- 🧠 Reflection: Understanding how to leverage LLMs for high-level robot control and action planning is crucial for building intuitive and intelligent robotic systems.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Content creation and task progression
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Focus on practical examples and configurations for the Capstone End-to-end robot pipeline.
