## Prompt

Draft the content for the file D:\Hacthone2025\my-website\docs\03-module-3-isaac\04-reinforcement-learning-humanoid.md. This chapter should delve into reinforcement learning techniques for training humanoid robots within Isaac Sim. Discuss RL algorithms, reward functions, simulation environments, and examples of training a bipedal robot. The content should be in markdown format compatible with Docusaurus.

## Response snapshot

The file D:\Hacthone2025\my-website\docs\03-module-3-isaac\04-reinforcement-learning-humanoid.md has been successfully updated with the drafted content.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Content for a chapter created.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests executed.
- 📁 Files: One file created/updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: None
- 🧠 Reflection: Encountered unexpected 'Read' requirement for new file creation, which was resolved by performing a read operation first.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Write tool requiring Read operation for new files.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate Write tool behavior for new file creation.
