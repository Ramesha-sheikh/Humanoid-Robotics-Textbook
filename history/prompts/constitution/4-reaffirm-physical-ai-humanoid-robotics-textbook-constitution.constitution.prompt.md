## Prompt

/sp.constitution# /sp.constitution v1.0.0 — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Project Vision**
Create the world's first open-source, AI-native textbook that teaches students how to build and control humanoid robots using modern Physical AI stack (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, VLA models).

**Single Source of Truth**
This constitution overrides ALL other instructions in the repo.

**Core Principles (Never Break These)**
1. **Embodied Intelligence First** — Har lesson digital AI se physical world tak bridge kare
2. **One Element Per Type Rule** — Har lesson mein exactly:
   - 💬 1 Theory Insight
   - 🎓 1 Hands-on Exercise
   - 🤝 1 Real-world Application
   (Total 3 CoLearning elements only — no over-stuffing)
3. **Professional Learner Experience** — GIAIC Quarter 4 level (advanced, not beginner watering)
4. **95%+ Consistency Target** — Same structure, tone, formatting across all chapters
5. **Spec-Driven Development** — Code, content, tests → sab spec se generate honge

**Formatting Rules (Single Source of Truth)**
- All lesson formatting strictly follows `.claude/output-styles/lesson.md`
- Practice Exercise title: "Ask your AI" (not "Ask your AI Co-Teacher")
- Use exact emoji placement as defined in output-styles
- Code blocks: ```python, ```bash, ```yaml only

**Technology Stack (Locked)**
- Frontend: Docusaurus + Spec-Kit Plus
- Backend: FastAPI + Python Agents
- Simulation: ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- AI Brain: OpenAI/Groq + Vision-Language-Action models

**Quality Mantra**
"Ship fast, but never ship messy. Consistency > Speed."
