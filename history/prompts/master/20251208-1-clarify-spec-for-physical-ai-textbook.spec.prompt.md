## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified key aspects of user identification and data scale for the Physical AI Textbook project.
- 🧪 Tests: No new tests added.
- 📁 Files: Updated D:\Hacthone2025\specs\master\spec.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully clarified user identification and data scale assumptions, recording them in the spec file. The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, so a fallback to agent-native PHR creation was performed.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PHR script not found, fallback to agent-native tool.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
