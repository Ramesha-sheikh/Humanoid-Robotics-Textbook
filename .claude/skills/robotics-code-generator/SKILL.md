# Robotics Code Generator

This skill generates Python code examples for various robotics applications. The code should be educational, well-commented, and practical.

## Format Requirements

All code should be output in markdown code blocks with proper Python syntax highlighting:

```python
# Your code here
```

## Instructions

- Generate Python code that demonstrates robotics concepts from the textbook
- Include detailed comments explaining each part of the code
- Use appropriate robotics libraries (like numpy, scipy, etc.)
- Ensure code follows Python best practices
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Provide brief explanation of what the code does
- Make sure code examples are practical and educational
